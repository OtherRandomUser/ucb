-- kind of necessary -- 
* make ir objects
    * double check vectors types
    * write verify methods (skipable)
* compile api
    * register allocation api
* instruction selection pass
    * add multiple use registers to root nodes
    * relax matching constraints to match types more flexibly (can be done after the first development pass)
* register allocation pass
* code emission

-- important, but skipable --
* integrate debug info

-- nice to have --
* quality of life features
* unit tests
* integration tests
* documentation
* data oriented design
* pointer wrappers/handles
* custom allocator
